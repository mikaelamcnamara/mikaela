						<h4 style="padding-bottom: 0; margin-bottom: 0; color: white;">Applying principles of sustainability to create viable systems </h4><br>
						<p>Sustainability is the idea of protecting our future quality of life and operating in a way that can be sustained indefinitely.  As engineers we need to be aware of sustainability and recognise how our project impacts the world environmentally, socially and economically. During my internship as a software engineer at IAG (Insurance Australia Group), I realised that the company is very big on Sustainability and encourages employees to apply principles of sustainability both company wide and within our individual projects.<br><br>
						
						Before starting my internship, sustainability wasnât something I considered as high priority as a software engineer. I didnât realise how much impact a small piece of software that only a few people use could have so much impact on the sustainability, economically, environmentally or socially.<br><br>

						To give a brief overview of what I was working on; I was within the location engineering team, under the data discovery umbrella, I was tasked with building a web-based mapping application designed to spatially allocate repairers to claims after major events. The old process to allocate claims was randomised and inefficient, repairers would be allocated to two claims in the same day in completely different areas, even though there was a claim super close to them. I needed to make this process more sustainable.<br><br>

						The app was built with a JavaScript front end, python back end and postgres database and had three development stages. The first stage of the project was to create the basis of the platform, a template more or less, because there will be multiple major events and the app cannot be tailored to one event. I used leaflet a JavaScript library to display the map, HTML5 and bootstrap a CSS framework for styling. The second stage required a user to be able to view all claims on the map, cluster them into a group, extract all the database data from those specific points and display them in a table (also downloadable as csv) and save the clustered area as coordinates in the database. This required a lot of server-side programming. The third stage of the project was to use an API (developed by another team) to allow users to assign a cluster of claims to a single repairer.<br><br>

						The project contributes to economic, environmental and social sustainability because it allows resources to be used more efficiently. Repairers now have a shorter distance between locations, saving fuel and reducing the need to make multiple long trips to transport resources. This means fuel consumption is reduced and less resources are lost or wasted, and some resources can be reused. The allocation process is also more sustainable as everything can be done in one application. I have learnt that applying the principles of sustainability to not only work projects but in my everyday life, is great for society and also optimizes the cost, scope and schedule of projects.<br><br></p></div>

						<h4 style="padding-bottom: 0; margin-bottom: 0; color: white;">Professional Practice within intercultural and global contexts </h4><br>
						At IAG, we have a very diverse workplace with people from all cultures working together. My team is not only very multicultural but also inclusive of individuals with different ages, religion, education and sexual orientation. This enables people to collaborate and share new ideas with different people every day. This has enabled me to make connections with people from backgrounds of all over the world and gain new perspectives that have helped me problem solve in different ways. I also feel constantly challenged, accepted and like I am growing both personally and professionally.<br><br>

						Comparing my internship at IAG to a previous internship I had completed in Shanghai China, there are some big differences. At IAG the working hours are extremely flexible, I can work anytime I like as long as I am working for around 8 hours. I normally get into the office around 9.15 and leave at 5.15 however many of my co-workers, for example, start at 6 am leave at 3, start at 11 am leave around 8 pm it does not matter as long as work is being completed. However, in Shanghai, I was stuck to a strict working schedule that usually resulting in working after hours even though I had a similar role for both internships. <br><br>

						Another noticeable comparison I made is that in Asian culture, silence is a good thing. It is an important part of the discussion and indicates the person is listening. In a multicultural workplace, this is not normal, silence is generally avoided and is seen as a negative thing. I am a quarter Chinese and grew up with a very Chinese background, I was taught not to speak up and share my thoughts, just to listen. I struggled a little bit when I first started my internship at IAG because I felt like I should be able to speak up and share my opinions, and I wanted to, It just wasnât natural for me but I have since learnt that voicing your opinions and ideas does not mean you are trying to be dominant or rude. It helps find more creative ways to solve problems and helps recognise different qualities within the workplace.<br><br>

						Another cultural difference I am aware of is relationship building. Growing up I was taught that the task is more important than the relationship (which doesnât align with Asian culture, I know) but being around people at work that have such strong friendships whether its outside of work or outside their specific team has made me want to be like that too. I am always aware of how much should I focus on the relationship especially considering as software engineer, I am on my computer a lot, I work by myself a lot, there is not much time to interact with people outside of the project scope unless I leave my desk and hang around the kitchen area. Working hard and getting the task done has always been my main priority but I am going to focus more on building relationships in the future.<br><br>

						After experiencing a very diverse workplace and a not so diverse workplace I can see the benefits of having different people from different places around the world. Having people that are flexible and open to different ideas and approaches to work is the best environment to work in. I have learnt a lot of numerous amounts of people and created friendships with people from all over the world.
